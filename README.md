# Disease-Prediction-ML
This project is a disease prediction system that takes symptoms as input and predicts the most likely disease using three machine learning models: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB), and Random Forest. The final prediction is determined by taking the mode of the predictions from these models.
